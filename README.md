## Urban Planning Decision Analysis Tool


**planInsight** helps UK construction professionals understand how long a planning application will **actually** take to be determined.

### Context...

- If you want to demolish, extend or construct a new building 🏢 you must obtain planning permission from your Local Authority (e.g. council) ✅
- Authorities are obliged to publish targets🎯 for determining urban planning applications, to help stakeholders and professionals plan ahead 📈

### Problem...

- Targets do not reflect each project’s 😕 complexity...
- Or how far behind or stretched the Local Authority is.
- Which means you cannot reliably plan around it. 🚧👷‍♂️


### Solution...

- Aggregate past applications and perform empirical analysis 📊 to reveal...
- How long ⏳ applications will **actually** take to be determined under similar parameters.
